# NewsNetNow

NewsNetNow is an online news organization that has a verity of topics they cover on the site. Hear we have the main page with a hero intro, followed by some individual news articles arranged in a specific layout. On this project I work with CSS Grid to allow us to get the specific grid layout for the page. We also used some PHP and launched the website on Netlify to get the subscription form to work properly. Using Media queries we are able to make the website mobile compatible with Ipad and IphoneX shown below.
